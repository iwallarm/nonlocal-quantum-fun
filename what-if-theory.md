## Introduction

Theories needs some experiments with themselves to raise new theories. And this is just one of them. This idea came from the quautum nonlocality phenomenon extrapotaled to the rest of the model. 

And it's quite simple assumption: what if the distance is irrelevant at all the all the Universe are in the same point (if it's possible to say this way).

In this scenario, quantum entanglement, where particles instantly affect each other regardless of distance, becomes a norm.

Then the speed of light as a defining factor for gravity in this context is intriguing. The speed of light now serve as a sort of "rate of interaction" or "*change*" rather than a speed over distance. 

And the gravity, traditionally understood as the curvature of spacetime around mass, now necame a manifestation of *how* these instantaneous interactions propagate changes in the quantum field.

This idea would suggest that gravitational effects are instantaneously communicated, similar to quantum entanglement, and that the speed of light is less about traversing space and more about the rate at which quantum states change or synchronize across the universe. This is an idea of how we can make some fun while radically shifts our understanding of both space-time and gravity, aligning them more closely with quantum theory.

## Redefining basics

Once the distance now doesn't exist and the speed of light defines changes in gravity, we can try with math for this speculative idea beyond the scope of existing physics. 

The universe would be a tapestry of interconnected quantum states, with changes propagating instantaneously, governed by the speed of light as a fundamental rate of change.

Now all the traditional concepts like force, energy, and even time would likely need to be redefined in terms of quantum states and fields. Let's speculate on it a bit:

**Force in Quantum Field Terms**:

   $F_{QF} = -\nabla \Phi$
   
   Where $F_{QF}$ represents the 'force' as a change or gradient in the quantum field state $ \Phi $. The idea is to express 'force' as a function of changes in the field configuration rather than as a result of mass and acceleration.

**Energy as a Quantum State Property**:

   $E_{QF} = \hbar \omega_{\Phi}$
   
   Where $E_{QF}$ represents the 'energy' associated with a particular quantum field state, with $\hbar$ being the reduced Planck constant and $\omega_{\Phi}$ the characteristic frequency or energy level of the quantum field state $ \Phi $.

**Time as a Measure of Quantum State Evolution**:

   $\Delta t_{QF} = \int \frac{d\Phi}{\delta \Phi_{evolution}}$
   
   Where $\Delta t_{QF}$ represents 'time' as a measure of the evolution or change in the quantum field state $\Phi$, with $\delta \Phi_{evolution}$ being the rate of change or evolution of the field state.

These is how we can try to align classical concepts with a quantum field-based perspective where spatial distance is not a fundamental aspect anymore (our speculative idea). But we can illustrate how traditional physics concepts might be reinterpreted in a universe dominated by quantum field interactions.

### Classic mechanic in quantum field terms

Now we can speculate a bit more and produce a kind of classic mechanics in new terms

**Momentum in Quantum Field Terms**:

   $P_{QF} = \hbar k_{\Phi}$
   
   Wher $P_{QF}$ represents 'momentum' in quantum field terms, with $\hbar$ being the reduced Planck constant and $k_{\Phi}$ representing the quantum field state's wave number. This aligns with the de Brogli wavelength concept but in a field-centric context.

**Quantum Field Potential Energy**:

   $U_{QF} = \int V(\Phi) \, d\Phi$
   
   Potential energy $U_{QF}$ in this context is defined by the integral of a potential function $V(\Phi)$ over the quantum field state $\Phi$. This represents the energy stored in field configurations.

**Quantum Field Kinetic Energy**:

   $K_{QF} = \frac{1}{2} m_{\Phi} v_{\Phi}^2$
   
   Kinetic energy $K_{QF}$ is reinterpreted with $m_{\Phi}$ as an effective mass term related to the field state and $v_{\Phi}$ as a term representing the rate of change or 'velocity' of the quantum field state.

**Quantum Field Work**:

   $W_{QF} = \int F_{QF} \cdot d\Phi$
   
   Work in quantum field terms $W_{QF}$ is defined as the integral of the quantum field 'force' $F_{QF}$ over changes in the quantum field state $\Phi$.

**Quantum Field Angular Momentum**:

   $L_{QF} = \hbar l_{\Phi}$
   
   Angular momentum $L_{QF}$ is defined in terms of the quantum field state's angular property $l_{\Phi}$, with $\hbar$ being the reduced Planck constant.

**Quantum Field-Based Einstein's Energy-Mass Equation**:

   $ E_{QF} = m_{\Phi} c^2 $
   
   This redefines Einstein's famous equation in quantum field terms, where $m_{\Phi}$ is an effective mass term associated with the quantum field state, and $c$ is the speed of light, possibly reinterpreted as a fundamental rate of quantum field interactions.

Reinterpreting traditional physics concepts in a universe where quantum fields are fundamental, and spatial distance is not a primary consideration are a kind on fun. They are hypothetical and intended to provide a conceptual framework for how classical physics might be reimagined in a quantum field-centric universe. Of course, this is not close to developing a full-size theory, but should be a enough to demostrate that the first step in this direction looks interesting if not promising.
